## General Progression by Steven Low

1. 30~40s chest to wall, feet on the wall, straight line body
    - half turn, fall on feet
2. 5~10s chest to wall with feet off the wall
    - toe tap or split feet
3. 10~20s feet off the wall, 60s feet on wall
4. 25% time kick ups & 75% 30~40s feet off the wall
5. 30~40s feet off wall -> 50%~75% kick ups
6. Never eliminate wall HS - 10~20% at lowest

### Main Keys for HS balance

- Hands & forearms should be doing most of the work
- Shoulders can burn but balance is all fingertips and palms
- HS is slightly overbalanced. Finger tip pulses to correct
- Body wobbles at shoulders, core, and hips make it harder
