## How to reduce injury rate

Ref: [RP Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixKX9LQlWjA)

1. Better technique
2. Controlled eccentrics
    - More result, and less injury
3. Deloading on time
    - Maybe more on intermediate phase
4. Smaller load progressions session to session
    - For me now, shoulder press is a good example
    - For intermediate and above, one week a pound is a damn good progress
5. Pauses on some bottom moves
    - Such as pull-ups, benches, squats, etc
    - When strong enough or asap
